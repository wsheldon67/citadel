Player
======

Represents a player in the game. This class has a lot of useful methods that are often the best ones to use to accomplish something. I would not recommend making changes to this class unless you need to, see if what you want can be accomplished by changing :py:class:`will_citadel.Game` or one of the :py:class:`will_citadel.Entity` subclasses.


.. autoclass:: will_citadel.Player
