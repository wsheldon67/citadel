Citadel documentation
=====================

I tried to use the same language as the rules as much as possible, but I did make a few abstractions, notably the :doc:`classes/entity` and the :doc:`classes/tile`.


.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   classes/game
   classes/entity
   classes/entity_list
   classes/tile
   classes/board
   classes/coordinate
   classes/player
   classes/helpers
